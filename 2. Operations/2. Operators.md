# Part 2: Operators ( Arithmetic and Comparison && Logical)

## 2.1. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on variables and values. The following operators are available:

| Operator | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Addition | Adds values on either side of the operator |
| - | Subtraction | Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand |
| * | Multiplication | Multiplies values on either side of the operator |
| / | Division | Divides left hand operand by right hand operand |
| % | Modulus | Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder |
| ** | Exponent | Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators |

### 2.1.1 Addition

Similar to when we use a calculator, using the addition operator will add two numbers together and return the sum. Lets look at some examples:

```python
print(1 + 1) # 2
print(2 + 2) # 4
print(3 + 5) # 8
print(4 + 2.4) # 6.4

my_favourite_number = 7
print(my_favourite_number + 1) # 8

my_2nd_favourite_number = 11
print(my_favourite_number + my_2nd_favourite_number) # 18

just_another_number = my_favourite_number + my_2nd_favourite_number
print(just_another_number) # 18
```

### 2.1.2 Subtraction

Similar to when we use a calculator, using the subtraction operator will subtract one number from another and return the difference. Lets look at some examples:

```python
print(1 - 1) # 0
print(2 - 2) # 0
print(3 - 5) # -2
print(4 - 2.4) # 1.6

my_favourite_number = 7
print(my_favourite_number - 1) # 6

my_2nd_favourite_number = 11
print(my_favourite_number - my_2nd_favourite_number) # -4

just_another_number = my_favourite_number - my_2nd_favourite_number
print(just_another_number) # -4
```

### 2.1.3 Multiplication

Similar to when we use a calculator, using the multiplication operator will multiply two numbers together and return the product. Lets look at some examples:

```python
print(1 * 1) # 1
print(2 * 2) # 4
print(3 * 5) # 15
print(4 * 2.4) # 9.6

my_favourite_number = 7
print(my_favourite_number * 1) # 7

my_2nd_favourite_number = 11
print(my_favourite_number * my_2nd_favourite_number) # 77

just_another_number = my_favourite_number * my_2nd_favourite_number
print(just_another_number) # 77
```

### 2.1.4 Division

Similar to when we use a calculator, using the division operator will divide one number by another and return the quotient. Lets look at some examples:

```python
print(1 / 1) # 1.0
print(2 / 2) # 1.0
print(3 / 5) # 0.6
print(4 / 2.4) # 1.6666666666666667

my_favourite_number = 7
print(my_favourite_number / 1) # 7.0

my_2nd_favourite_number = 11
print(my_favourite_number / my_2nd_favourite_number) # 0.6363636363636364

just_another_number = my_favourite_number / my_2nd_favourite_number
print(just_another_number) # 0.6363636363636364
```

### 2.1.5 Modulus

By using the modulus character, we can divide one number by another and return the remainder. Lets look at some examples:

```python
print(1 % 1) # 0 -> 1 goes into 1 once, with no remainder
print(2 % 2) # 0 -> 2 goes into 2 once, with no remainder
print(3 % 5) # 3 -> 5 goes into 3 zero times, with a remainder of 3
print(4 % 2.4) # 1.6 -> 2.4 goes into 4 once, with a remainder of 1.6

my_favourite_number = 7
print(my_favourite_number % 1) # 0 -> 1 goes into 7 seven times, with no remainder

my_2nd_favourite_number = 11
print(my_favourite_number % my_2nd_favourite_number) # 7 -> 11 goes into 7 zero times, with a remainder of 7

just_another_number = my_favourite_number % my_2nd_favourite_number
print(just_another_number) # 7 -> 11 goes into 7 zero times, with a remainder of 7
```

### 2.1.6 Exponent

By using the exponent character, we can raise one number to the power of another. Lets look at some examples:

```python
print(1 ** 1) # 1 -> 1 * 1
print(2 ** 2) # 4 -> 2 * 2
print(3 ** 5) # 243 -> 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3
print(4 ** 2.4) # 27.85761802547597 -> 2.4 * 2.4 * 2.4 * 2.4

my_favourite_number = 7
print(my_favourite_number ** my_favourite_number) # 823543 -> 7 * 7 * 7 * 7 * 7 * 7 * 7

my_2nd_favourite_number = 11
print(my_favourite_number ** my_2nd_favourite_number) # 1977326743

just_another_number = my_favourite_number ** my_2nd_favourite_number
print(just_another_number) # 1977326743
```

## 2.2. Comparison Operators

Comparison, as the name implies - are used to compare two values or variables. This can be useful when we want to check if a value is equal to another value, or if one value is greater than another. Use cases include checking if someone is old enough to drive, or to sort some numbers from smallest to largest. Comparison Operators return a boolean value (True or False) depending on the outcome of the comparison. The following operators are available:

| Operator | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| == | Equal | If the values of two values are equal, then the condition becomes true |
| != | Not Equal | If values of two values are not equal, then condition becomes true |
| > | Greater Than | If the value of left value is greater than the value of right value, then condition becomes true |
| < | Less Than | If the value of left value is less than the value of right value, then condition becomes true |
| >= | Greater Than or Equal To | If the value of left value is greater than or equal to the value of right value, then condition becomes true |
| <= | Less Than or Equal To | If the value of left value is less than or equal to the value of right value, then condition becomes true |

<i>
    Note: the exclamation mark (!) is commonly used in programming to mean 'not'. For example, != means 'not equal to'.
</i>

### 2.2.1 Equal

The equal operator checks if the value of the first variable, is equal to the second variable. Lets look at some examples:

```python
print(1 == 1) # True -> 1 is equal to 1
print(2**2 == 5) # False -> 2**2 is equal to 4, so 2**2 is not equal to 5

# Equality is case-sensitive
print("John" == "John") # True -> "John" is equal to "John"
print("John" == "john") # False -> "John" is not equal to "john"

# Booleans are values too!
print(True == True) # True
print(False == False) # True -> don't worry that the value says False, the important thing is that they're both false - which makes them equal

print(True == False) # False
print(False == True) # False

# We can also compare variables
my_favourite_number = 7
my_2nd_favourite_number = 11

print(my_favourite_number == my_2nd_favourite_number) # False -> 7 is not equal to 11

comparison = my_favourite_number == my_2nd_favourite_number
print(comparison) # False -> 7 is not equal to 11
```

### 2.2.2 Not Equal

The not equal operator checks if the value of the first variable, is not equal to the second variable. Lets look at some examples:

```python
print(1 != 2) # True -> 1 is not equal to 2
print(2**2 != 5) # True -> 2**2 is equal to 4, so 2**2 is not equal to 5
print(2**2 != 4) # False -> 2**2 is equal to 4, so 2**2 is equal to 4

# Equality is case-sensitive
print("John" != "John") # False -> "John" is equal to "John"
print("John" != "john") # True -> "John" is not equal to "john"

# Booleans are values too!
print(True != True) # False
print(False != False) # False

print(True != False) # True
print(False != True) # True

# We can also compare variables, and assign the outcome to a variable
my_favourite_number = 7
my_2nd_favourite_number = 11

print(my_favourite_number != my_2nd_favourite_number) # True -> 7 is not equal to 11

comparison = my_favourite_number != my_2nd_favourite_number
print(comparison) # True -> 7 is not equal to 11
```

### 2.2.3 Greater Than
```python
print(1 > 2) # False -> 1 is not greater than 2
print(2**2 > 5) # False -> 2**2 is equal to 4, so 2**2 is not greater than 5
print(2**2 > 4) # False -> 2**2 is equal to 4, so 2**2 is not greater than 4

# Equality is case-sensitive
print("John" > "John") # False -> "John" is equal to "John"
print("John" > "john") # False -> "John" is not greater than "john" (in programming, are assigned a higher value than lowercase letters)

# Booleans are values too!
print(True > True) # False
print(False > False) # False

print(True > False) # True -> True is greater than False
print(False > True) # False

# We can also compare variables, and assign the outcome to a variable
my_favourite_number = 7
my_2nd_favourite_number = 11

print(my_favourite_number > my_2nd_favourite_number) # False -> 7 is not greater than 11

comparison = my_favourite_number > my_2nd_favourite_number
print(comparison) # False -> 7 is not greater than 11
```

### 2.2.4 Less Than
```python
print(1 < 2) # True -> 1 is less than 2
print(2**2 < 5) # False -> 2**2 is equal to 4, so 2**2 is not less than 5
print(2**2 < 4) # False -> 2**2 is equal to 4, so 2**2 is not less than 4

# Equality is case-sensitive
print("John" < "John") # False -> "John" is equal to "John"
print("John" < "john") # True -> "John" is less than "john" (in programming, are assigned a higher value than lowercase letters)

# Booleans are values too!
print(True < True) # False
print(False < False) # False

print(True < False) # False
print(False < True) # True -> False is less than True

# We can also compare variables, and assign the outcome to a variable
my_favourite_number = 7
my_2nd_favourite_number = 11

print(my_favourite_number < my_2nd_favourite_number) # True -> 7 is less than 11

comparison = my_favourite_number < my_2nd_favourite_number
print(comparison) # True -> 7 is less than 11
```

### 2.2.5 Greater Than or Equal To
```python
print(1 >= 2) # False -> 1 is not greater than or equal to 2
print(2**2 >= 5) # False -> 2**2 is equal to 4, so 2**2 is not greater than or equal to 5
print(2**2 >= 4) # True -> 2**2 is equal to 4, so 2**2 is greater than or equal to 4

# Equality is case-sensitive
print("John" >= "John") # True -> "John" is equal to "John"
print("John" >= "john") # False -> "John" is not greater than or equal to "john" (in programming, are assigned a higher value than lowercase letters)

# Booleans are values too!
print(True >= True) # True
print(False >= False) # True

print(True >= False) # True
print(False >= True) # False -> False is not greater than or equal to True

# We can also compare variables, and assign the outcome to a variable
my_favourite_number = 7
my_2nd_favourite_number = 11

print(my_favourite_number >= my_2nd_favourite_number) # False -> 7 is not greater than or equal to 11

comparison = my_favourite_number >= my_2nd_favourite_number
print(comparison) # False -> 7 is not greater than or equal to 11
```

### 2.2.6 Less Than or Equal To
```python
print(1 <= 2) # True -> 1 is less than or equal to 2
print(2**2 <= 5) # False -> 2**2 is equal to 4, so 2**2 is not less than or equal to 5
print(2**2 <= 4) # True -> 2**2 is equal to 4, so 2**2 is less than or equal to 4

# Equality is case-sensitive
print("John" <= "John") # True -> "John" is equal to "John"
print("John" <= "john") # True -> "John" is less than or equal to "john" (in programming, are assigned a higher value than lowercase letters)

# Booleans are values too!
print(True <= True) # True
print(False <= False) # True

print(True <= False) # False -> True is not less than or equal to False
print(False <= True) # True

# We can also compare variables, and assign the outcome to a variable
my_favourite_number = 7
my_2nd_favourite_number = 11

print(my_favourite_number <= my_2nd_favourite_number) # True -> 7 is less than or equal to 11

comparison = my_favourite_number <= my_2nd_favourite_number
print(comparison) # True -> 7 is less than or equal to 11
```

## 2.3. Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine and manipulate the outcome of comparison operators. The following operators are available:

| Operator | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| and / && | Logical AND | If both the operands are true then condition becomes true |
| or / \|\| | Logical OR | If any of the two operands are non-zero then condition becomes true |
| not / ! | Logical NOT | Used to reverse the logical state of its operand |

### 2.3.1 Logical AND ( && )

The logical AND operator checks if both the left and right values are true. Lets look at some examples:

<i>
    Note: In the table above I have included both the Python, and in brackets the standard programming notation for the operators. You can use either in Python, but I would recommend using the Python notation.
</i>
<br><br>
<i>
    Note: When evaluating logical operators, Python will stop evaluating as soon as it knows the outcome. For example, if the first value is False, then it will not evaluate the second value, as it already knows the outcome will be False.
</i>

<br>
<br>

```python
print(True and True) # True -> True and True is True
print(True and False) # False -> True and False is False

print(1 == 1 and 2 == 2) # True -> 1 is equal to 1, and 2 is equal to 2
print(1 == 1 and 2 == 3) # False -> 1 is equal to 1, but 2 is not equal to 3

print("John" == "John" and "Doe" == "Doe") # True -> "John" is equal to "John", and "Doe" is equal to "Doe"
print("John" == "John" and "Doe" == "Smith") # False -> "John" is equal to "John", but "Doe" is not equal to "Smith"
```

### 2.3.2 Logical OR ( || )

The logical OR operator checks if either the left or right values are true. Lets look at some examples:

```python
print(True or True) # True -> True or True is True
print(True or False) # True -> True or False is True

print(1 == 1 or 2 == 2) # True -> 1 is equal to 1, or 2 is equal to 2
print(1 == 1 or 2 == 3) # True -> even though 2 is not equal to 3, 1 is equal to 1, so the outcome is True

print("John" == "John" or "Doe" == "Doe") # True -> "John" is equal to "John", or "Doe" is equal to "Doe"
print("John" == "John" or "Doe" == "Smith") # True -> even though "Doe" is not equal to "Smith", "John" is equal to "John", so the outcome is True
```

### 2.3.3 Logical NOT ( ! )

The logical NOT operator can be used to achieve one of the following
1. Invert the outcome of a comparison
2. Check if a value is 'truthy'

<em>
    Note: 'Truthiness' is a concept in programming that refers to whether a value is considered true or false. In Python, the following values are considered false:

| Operator | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| False | false | a boolean value |
| None | null | a special value in Python that represents nothing or null |
| 0 | zero | an integer |
| 0.0 | zero point zero | a float |
| 0j | zero j | a complex number |
| "" | empty string | a string without any alphanumeric characters or spaces |
| [] | empty list | a list without any items |
| () | empty tuple | a tuple without any items |
| {} | empty dictionary | a dictionary without any items |
| set() | empty set | a set without any items |
| range(0) | empty range | a range without any items |
</em>

Lets look at some examples:

```python
print(not True) # False -> True is not False
print(not False) # True -> False is not True

print(not 1 == 1) # False -> 1 is equal to 1, so not 1 == 1 is False
print(not 1 == 2) # True -> 1 is not equal to 2, so not 1 == 2 is True

print(not "John" == "John") # False -> "John" is equal to "John", so not "John" == "John" is False
print(not "John" == "Doe") # True -> "John" is not equal to "Doe", so not "John" == "Doe" is True

print(not "John") # False -> "John" is a string, and is not an empty string, so not "John" is False
print(not "") # True -> "" is an empty string, so not "" is True

print(not 1) # False -> 1 is an integer, and is not 0, so not 1 is False
print(not 0) # True -> 0 is an integer, and is 0, so not 0 is True
```

## 2.4. Advanced Usage & Examples

### 2.4.1. Using Brackets to Increase Readability & Manipulate Order of Operations

When using multiple comparison operators, brackets can be used to specify the order of operations, and improve readability of complicated statements. Lets look at some examples:

```python
# Using brackets won't change the outcome, but it will make it easier to read
print( (1==1) and (2==2) ) # True -> 1 is equal to 1, and 2 is equal to 2
print( 1==1 and 2==2 ) # True -> 1 is equal to 1, and 2 is equal to 2
```

```python
# Using brackets will change the outcome, as it will change the order of operations
print( 1==1 and 2==3 or 4==4 ) # True -> 1 is equal to 1, and 2 is not equal to 3, but 4 is equal to 4
print( (1==1 and 2==3) or 4==4 ) # True -> 1 is equal to 1, and 2 is not equal to 3, but 4 is equal to 4
print( 1==1 and (2==3 or 4==4) ) # True -> 1 is equal to 1, and 2 is not equal to 3, but 4 is equal to 4
```

```python
# We can also use brackets to apply the NOT operator to a comparison
print( not 1==1 and not 2==3 or 3==3 ) # True -> 1 is equal to 1, and 2 is not equal to 3, but 3 is equal to 3
print( not ( 1==1 and not (2==3 or 3==3) ) ) # False -> 1 is equal to 1, and 2 is not equal to 3, but 3 is equal to 3
```

### 2.4.2. Using NOT Equal to Check if a Value is Not 'Truthy'

We can use the not equal operator to check if a value is not 'truthy'. Lets look at some examples:

```python
print(not 1) # False -> 1 is an integer, and is not 0, so not 1 is False
print(not 0) # True -> 0 is an integer, and is 0, so not 0 is True

print(not "John") # False -> "John" is a string, and is not an empty string, so not "John" is False
print(not "") # True -> "" is an empty string, so not "" is True

print(not True) # False -> True is not False, so not True is False
print(not False) # True -> False is not True, so not False is True

print(not None) # True -> None is not a value, so not None is True
```

### 2.4.3. Using Compound NOT Operators to Check if a Value is 'Truthy'

We can use the compound NOT operator to check if a value is 'truthy'. Lets look at some examples:

```python
print(not not 1) # True -> 1 is NOT a 'falsey' value, so not 1 is False, and not not 1 is True
```

Let's break this down further:
1. `not 1` -> `False`
2. `not not 1` -> `not False` -> `True`

```python
print(not not 0) # False -> 0 is a 'falsey' value, so not 0 is True, and not not 0 is False
```

Let's break this down further:
1. `not 0` -> `True`
2. `not not 0` -> `not True` -> `False`
