# Part 3: Control Flow

## 3.1 Conditional Execution

There are many times in programming that you will want to make branching paths in your code. For example, Bioware games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age have many branching paths that change the story based on the player's choices. In programming, we can use control flow to make branching paths in our code.

In this chapter, we will learn about how to tell our program to behave differently based on certain conditions. We will also learn about how to repeat code using loops.

### 3.1.1 If Statements

Imagine that you are deciding what to wear for your exciting date tomorrow, with Kai, from art class, with Mr. Fletcher - the grumpy thirty-something always in a smock despite never picking up a brush. No matter your outfit, looks are not everything - it needs to be practical too. You decide to check the weather forecast to see if you need to bring an umbrella.

```python
# Lets create some variables that will describe the weather tomorrow
is_raining = False
is_sunny = True
is_windy = True
temperature = 20
measuring_unit = "Celsius"
```

We can use an `if` statement to check if it is raining, and print a message to the console if it is:

The way we write an if statement uses the following syntax:

`if` *condition* `:`

Please note also in the below example, that code to be executed if the condition is true is indented. This is important, as Python uses indentation to determine which code is part of the if statement.

```python
print("Lets think about what to wear/bring tomorrow...")

# Check if it is raining
if is_raining == True:
    print("I should bring an umbrella!")

print("It's decided then.")
```
Output:
```
Lets think about what to wear/bring tomorrow...
print("It's decided then!")
```

But wait, where did our message about bringing an umbrella go? It didn't print to the console because it was indented as a part of that if-block, and that if-block will only wake-up if it's raining... Time to make it rain!

Lets change the value of `is_raining` to `True` and run the code again:

```python
is_raining = True
```
Output:
```
Lets think about what to wear/bring tomorrow...
I should bring an umbrella!
It's decided then!
```

That's looking much better! Now we can see that the message about bringing an umbrella is only printed if it is raining.

Lets add some more conditions to our if statement, don't hestitate to refer back to section 2 for a refresher on operators.

```python
print("Lets think about what to wear/bring tomorrow...")

if is_sunny:
    print("I should bring sunglasses!")
    print("I should bring sunscreen!")
    print("I should bring a hat")

# Check if it is raining
if is_raining == True and is_windy == False:
    print("I should bring an umbrella!")

if is_windy == True and is_raining == False:
    print("I should bring a jacket!")

if is_windy == True and is_raining == False:
    print("I should bring a raincoat!")

if temperature > 25 and measuring_unit == "Celsius":
    print("I should wear shorts!")

if temperature < 25 and measuring_unit == "Celsius":
    print("I should wear trousers!")

if temperature < 25 and measuring_unit == "Fahrenheit":
    print("Forget the date, we've entered the ice age!")

print("It's decided then.")
```

Have a play around with our intial variables, and see what happens to the output when you change them. You should see that the output changes depending on the values of the variables.

### Shortening == True and == False to Improve Readability

Using what we know about 'truthy' and 'falsey' values, we can leverage this information to greatly reduce the amount of code we need to write. Lets look at some examples:

```python
# Using the following variables:
a_truthy_bool = True
a_truthy_integer = 1
a_truthy_string = "John"

a_falsey_bool = False
a_falsey_integer = 0
a_falsey_string = ""

# We can shorten the following if statements:
if a_truthy_bool == True:
    print("Truthy bool")

if a_truthy_integer > 0:
    print("Truthy integer")

if a_truthy_string != "":
    print("Truthy string")

if a_falsey_bool == False:
    print("Falsey bool")

if a_falsey_integer == 0:
    print("Falsey integer")

if a_falsey_string == "":
    print("Falsey string")

# To the following:
if a_truthy_bool:
    print("Truthy bool")

if a_truthy_integer:
    print("Truthy integer")

if a_truthy_string:
    print("Truthy string")

if not a_falsey_bool:
    print("Falsey bool")

if not a_falsey_integer:
    print("Falsey integer")

if not a_falsey_string:
    print("Falsey string")
```

Lets apply this logic to our weather example:

```python
print("Lets think about what to wear/bring tomorrow...")

if is_sunny:
    print("I should bring sunglasses!")
    print("I should bring sunscreen!")
    print("I should bring a hat")

# Check if it is raining
if is_raining and not is_windy:
    print("I should bring an umbrella!")

if is_windy and not is_raining:
    print("I should bring a jacket!")

if is_windy and is_raining:
    print("I should bring a raincoat!")

if temperature > 25 and measuring_unit == "Celsius":
    print("I should wear shorts!")

if temperature < 25 and measuring_unit == "Celsius":
    print("I should wear trousers!")

if temperature < 25 and measuring_unit == "Fahrenheit":
    print("Forget the date, we've entered the ice age!")

print("It's decided then.")
```

This is looking much easier to read without those pesky equality operators (==) everywhere!

Congratulations, this process of making our code better, and more readable is called refactoring. Refactoring is a very important part of programming, and we will be doing a lot of it throughout this course.

### 3.1.2 Else Statements

We can use an `else` statement to execute code if the condition of an `if` statement is false. Lets look at an example:

```python
my_favourite_animal = "cat"
my_partners_favourite_animal = "dog"

if my_favourite_animal == my_partners_favourite_animal:
    print("Welcome to the cat haven!")
else:
    print("So... one of each?")
```

Output:
```
So... one of each?
```

Using an `else` statement is a great way to handle situations where your `if` statement is false, but we still want to do something. In the above example, we are handling the situation where our favourite animals are different.

There are some sections in our weather example that would benefit from this logic, instead of checking if `temperature > 25` and then checking if `temperature < 25`, we can use an `else` statement to handle the situation where `temperature < 25`.

```python
# -- Before
if temperature > 25 and measuring_unit == "Celsius":
    print("I should wear shorts!")

if temperature < 25 and measuring_unit == "Celsius":
    print("I should wear trousers!")

# -- After
if temperature > 25 and measuring_unit == "Celsius":
    print("I should wear shorts!")
else:
    print("I should wear trousers!")
```

That's looking much nicer! If anything isn't making sense so far, don't be afraid to play with the values and see what happens, you can always re-copy the code from above if you break it. Programming is all about learning what NOT to do!

### 3.1.3 Elif Statements

Sometimes, we may want to cater for more scenarios than simply if A else B. We can use an `elif` statement to check for additional conditions before falling back to the `else` statement. Lets look at an example:

```python
# My partner and I are struggling what pet to get for our daughter. We have narrowed it down to a cat or a dog.
# We have decided that if we can't agree, we will get one of each.
# I really want a cat, so +1 to cats!
# My partner really wants a dog, so +1 to dogs...
# Our daughter wants her own little Garfield, so +1 to cats!

cat_votes = 2
dog_votes = 1

# Lets write an if, elif, else statement to help summarise the votes and decide what pet to get.

if cat_votes > dog_votes:
    print("We're getting a cat!")
elif dog_votes > cat_votes:
    print("We're getting a dog...")
else:
    print("We're getting one of each!")
```

Lets apply this logic to our weather example:

```python
# -- Before
if is_raining and not is_windy:
    print("I should bring an umbrella!")

if is_windy and not is_raining:
    print("I should bring a jacket!")

if is_windy and is_raining:
    print("I should bring a raincoat!")

# -- After
if not is_windy and is_raining:
    print("I should bring an umbrella!")
elif is_windy and not is_raining:
    print("I should bring a jacket!")
else:
    print("I should bring a raincoat!")
```

### 3.1.4 Nested If Statements

We can nest if statements inside other if statements. This is useful for checking for additional conditions. Lets look at an example:

```python
# I love to use my aeropress in the morning to make coffee, but I need to make sure I have all of my equipment before I can make it.
# I need to make sure I have my aeropress, my coffee, my grinder, my kettle, and my mug.

# If I have my mug, and coffee, and kettle, I will have to settle for instant coffee.

# If I don't have my mug, coffee, and kettle - I can't make coffee at all!
has_aeropress = True
has_coffee = True
has_grinder = True
has_kettle = True
has_mug = True

if has_mug:
    if has_coffee:
        if has_kettle:
            if has_grinder:
                if has_aeropress:
                    print("I can make coffee!")
            else:
                print("I can make instant coffee...")
        else:
            print("I can't make coffee...")
    else:
        print("I can't make coffee...")
else:
    print("I can't make coffee...")
```

#### <b> THIS CODE SUCKS! </b>

Now I'd like to point something out, and that's reading code is hard - but it's even more difficult when it's written poorly. Lets refactor this code to make it more readable:

```python
if has_mug and has_coffee and has_kettle and has_grinder and has_aeropress:
    print("I can make coffee!")
elif has_mug and has_coffee and has_kettle:
    print("I can make instant coffee...")
else:
    print("I can't make coffee...")
```

Ahh, that's much better! Now we can see that we have three scenarios:

Things to talk about:
- while
- for
- break
- continue
- pass
- ternary
- if-inversion
